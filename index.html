                <h2 id="first">Overview of The Problem:</h2>
                <p>The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for positive utility is having more negative
                    damage to society than we can fathom. This article is going to help detail why, and detail our
                    solution in progress. </p>

                <p>As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an intrinsic motivator in the rest of
                    our actions. Status comes in many forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest
                    status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury goods like a Gucci bag/belt
                    have become widespread as top status symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of
                    status. It has become such common Christmas list item for broke young teenagers that the richest man
                    on the planet at the time of this writing got his riches from selling these overpriced goods
                    representing nothing more than the ability to waste money. Collectively this misrepresentation of
                    true status (service to others) is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive culture
                    than we can imagine.</p>

                Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could be used collectively to unify
                humanity around bettering ourselves and others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a
                false form of status as a service. Imagine a world where this wasteful spending was considered
                cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the capability to money to the positive
                growth of us as a species. Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off spending a lot
                of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute
                the wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this new alignment would have.
                </p>
                <div class="quotes">‚ÄúOver the past hundred years we have increase the global GDP sevenfold, yet wealth
                    inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows rapidly. In order to change the failure
                    of redistribution of wealth at scale, we must effectively influence culture and help redefine what
                    ‚Äústatus‚Äù is in the modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of money in society as the new
                    age of status being helping the world, becomes more prominent. We have failed at building a society
                    which healthily distributes wealth/power. Given society is a collective project we are responsible
                    for, we think this stems from the culture not supporting doing good as the highest form of status.
                    We have more than enough resources, but many people without access to them, and a culture that
                    motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.‚Äù - Jack Jay</div>

                <h2 id="two">A Deeper Dive:</h2>
                <p>On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in food, water, shelter. They can
                    start to spend their time and money on convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not;
                    status is where a majority of surplus wealth goes. </p>
                <p>Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating a better world and with bettering
                    ourselves. This idea to change what we cultural see as status has been referred to as ‚ÄúStatus
                    Engineering‚Äù. </p>
                <p>What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves and our ideals/values. What your
                    role model wears, or any person of influence is shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager,
                    or adults mind. </p>
                <p><strong>
                        Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra for a certain brand of
                        T-Shirt irrespective of comfort. </strong></p>
                <p>The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an individual. Status is a form of
                    positive competitive drive in society and a tool for respect attribution. That‚Äôs why you see Dior
                    shoes in economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the status from spending $1100 on shoes
                    does have more long term value than things like first class because we are playing the game of
                    unenlightened capitalism.</p>
                <p>The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100 and does no good for humanity.
                    Thus this expenditure is not a failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we
                    do not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in Bangladesh (a small home
                    can be built as a permanent structure for someone for this amount). We need higher forms of status
                    to exist in order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of wealth and power on
                    a systemic level. </p>
                <p>Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely financial status seems become recognized
                    for their tackiness and buying status will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative
                    currently, we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we are, the clothing we
                    wear, we display 0 creativity or care for the world in spending and instead promote wasting wealth
                    for the sake of power/leverage over others, and then we wonder why society is misaligned to building
                    a healthy world. Fashion, what we wear, is the biggest signal we have in representing our identity
                    and values.</p>
                <p>If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing we can not only change the money used
                    to buy status into doing good for the world, but we can change our core representation of status in
                    society towards doing good.</p>
                <p>While the larger belief is that this systemic change is the real impact in realigning our culture
                    towards true status, the amount of funds in status spending that could be redirected towards
                    positive causes is also no joke. </p>
                <p class="quotes">The personal luxury goods market is projected to grow from USD 257.26 billion in 2020
                    to USD 352.84 billion in 2027</p>
                <p class="quotes">The Luxury Cars Market size is expected to grow from USD 449.7 Billion in 2019 to USD
                    655.0 Billion by 2027; It is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2020 to 2027. </p>
                <p>Aligning status culturally on a global scale means reattributing that wealth towards benefit for
                    humanity and shifting the entire global view of wealth. </p>
                <h2 id="three">The Simple Solution</h2>
                <p><strong>Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and just has not been tried in
                        the market. Once one initial company opens up this model, many more will follow and
                        copy:</strong></p>
                <p>For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be built in Bangladesh for a
                    family in need. This gives rise to the idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and
                    purchased an item, they are having to burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly).
                </p>
                <p>Based on the principle ‚Äúif a penny saved is a penny earned‚Äù we can extrapolate that to a Louie bag is
                    a home burned. But just telling someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really
                    want to win this war, we just need to sell higher status, for the same price. </p>
                <div class="in-im"><img class="inner-img" src="body.png"></div>
                <p>Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors outside of a designer store. Rather
                    than simply protesting their spending on that good, we need to sell them a better version of what
                    they are buying. </p>
                <p>Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up showing customers videos of the
                    harmed animals may not be a great way to connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater
                    divide in mindsets. </p>
                <p>In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of luxury goods markets, sporting the
                    aligned luxury merch. Rodeo drive for example is a notorious spot where every designer store not
                    only has a shop, but theres a steady flow of customers. </p>
                <p>Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already massively viral amassing hundreds of
                    millions of views interviewing buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a viral video and
                    an ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new customers while kickstarting educating the world of
                    the low status of wasteful spending now that a better alternative exists. </p>
                <h2 id="four">Large Scale Cultural Engineering </h2>
                <p><strong>Making Altruism Culturally High Status.</strong></p>
                <p>We don‚Äôt need to enforce rules where people are forced to give up their things, we need brands that
                    invest in education for the masses to wake up to what real status/value is and place higher
                    alternatives into the market. </p>
                <p>With the release of more and more globally disruptive technology, anxiousness about our focus on
                    making sure things goes right becomes more apparent. By educating the world on alignment of using
                    money and power for good from the most basic layer of apparel we will begin to cause this shift.
                    With the right priming, a large amount of legacy wealth will be funneled into shifting the global
                    workforce into focusing on the worlds greatest problems. </p>
                <h2 id="five">Bringing The Inevitable Future Forward</h2>
                <p>There‚Äôs a vibe shift underway, as we get closer and closer to a post scarcity economy, the eternal
                    currency of the future of good karma will become more clear.
                </p>
                <p>For the greedy who still wish to hold on to ownership of something land is going to skyrocket as an
                    asset, ownership on plots of earth will be seen as one of the steadiest investments as we approach a
                    hyper decrease in the cost of building. </p>
                <p>The people who recognize this shift will do well to mortgage their house, buying a larger plot of
                    land somewhere. </p>
                <p>If super-intelligence is democratic, honoring that ownership of land will be a decision the world
                    makes. (Clearly the idea that those who hoarded their wealth and tried to hold on to value should
                    have more value than those who put their wealth to work, giving up their assets, is one that will be
                    a hard attempt) Propaganda for people to relinquish their assets to funds more of the poverty of the
                    world will help the world make this decision when the time comes. </p>
                <p>While theres no specific data for what defines ‚ÄúLuxury‚Äù housing, this is of course a far larger asset
                    class which outshines the luxury car and luxury goods market.</p>
                <p>What actually makes one house better than the other (often its simply the status it has rather than
                    utility) if it was all about utility people would buy the cheaper house and install the heated seat
                    toilets, and floors etc. (but then how would people respect them more?). What if we were not ranked
                    by the size of our house, but instead by the size of our donations.</p>
                <p>You may remember that app that was $999 called ‚ÄúIm rich‚Äù and did nothing. That‚Äôs what designer
                    clothing represents today. Useless expense for materials with patterns that represent pure vanity.
                    Pure spending power gone to pure status.</p>
                <p>It is tasteless‚Ä¶. and we believe society is not only waking up to that fact, but it is inevitable
                    that we will create better alternatives.</p>
                <p>In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style goods declining while a push for
                    understated looks are coming forward. Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more oversaturated, and
                    pieces that lack design besides the plastery of the luxury logo on the piece are seen as tacky.</p>
                <p>Evidence of this:</p>
                <p>Brands like Gucci are becoming less hip.</p>
                <p>Designer brands that are in your face are not it.</p>
                <p>Designer that‚Äôs low-key is now the trend.</p>
                <p>Designer is dialing back as consumers replace spending to these models.</p>
                <p>We believe the changing of status starting at a clothing level will cause one of the largest wealth
                    flow transfers towards good for the world. Imagine an individual who is struggling to provide for
                    themselves, eventually however, they begin to thrive. They start a business and after having major
                    success exit for a few million dollars. What is the standard look and lifestyle of this person after
                    this event?</p>
                <p>For the most part, most people are living to keep their ‚Äúsocial survival mammoth‚Äù feeling good. This
                    is the part of the brain which feeds off of status, which defines our place in the social hierarchy.
                    And this is not something I believe we can change, people WILL naturally compete to go up the chain
                    of the social hierarchy, people want to outdo each other, people are competitive, people are
                    different and respect should be given where it is due. </p>
                <p>This climb, this fight up the ladder is not inherently bad, what's wrong right now is what we
                    consider to be markers of people who are higher up that ladder. We have been sold a narrative by the
                    luxury and designer corporations, who have massive budgets to win the celebrities over, that
                    designer and luxury clothing IS high status. Those who spend $4k on a designer bag versus one of
                    equivalent quality for $50 are put higher on the status scale. If we can collectively redefine this
                    status symbol as tacky, which has already been changing for in-your-face luxury design brand styles,
                    we will change where the money which pays for status goes.</p>
                <p>While projects like Shelter NFT would build a home for a family who would have otherwise never had
                    one before for the same price as a designer bag, it is no replacement for a BAG. People still want
                    to buy a high end item, so instead, a brand which offers that price of bag, that level of quality,
                    whose surplus funds goes towards making that positive change is perfect.</p>
